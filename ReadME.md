This project is a comprehensive collection of solutions to a wide variety of coding problems commonly encountered in technical interviews. It covers a broad range of topics including algorithms, data structures, problem-solving patterns, and optimization techniques. The repository serves as a valuable resource for:

Preparing for coding interviews.
Practicing problem-solving strategies.
Exploring optimal solutions to real-world challenges.


Projects:

1 - ArxPractice, is a collection of problems that I have solved on various platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, etc. The solution to each problem is coded in c# and Rust or go
2 - ArxAlgorithm, is a collection of solutions to existing algortithems.
